# some-project

This project has been created as a prototype for YaeC.

It consists of a new, more efficient search engine to replace the existing one.

We can connect to the Production DB using the credentials below :

- user : ************
- password : ************


The idea is to use Elasticsearch for autocomplete, search and suggestions.
